# Contractor Guidelines
## Coding Standards

We want to allow you the freedom to code your site in a way you are comfortable with. But we also have certain requirements that we would like you to adhere to.

The code you submit will be:-

__Readable__ – all variables, functions, classes and IDs should be clearly labelled to describe their intention in a manner that another developer can follow easily.

__Formatted correctly__ – Code should be indented, spaced and presented clearly so that it can be easily followed and edited if required.

__Secure__ – FTP login details, account passwords and other data that can reasonably be deemed confidential or a security hazard: Your code should not expose the site or server to malicious attacks by revealing these or storing them as plain text.

We would also like you to use as few plugins as you can, particularly if you are building a Wordpress site. This is due to potential security issues and ongoing maintenance overheads.

__Efficient__ –it is important to us that you consider your performance. We do not set specific performance budgets, but if a site is deemed to be unreasonably slow when tested, we may ask that you refactor your code. So please try to use as few HTTP requests as is possible by concatenating your JS and CSS, and by using as few image files as is reasonably possible from the designs you are given. Any image or vector files you do use must be created at reasonable sizes and be minified.

__Extensible__ – your code should be written in a way that will allow future growth. Templates must not be so granular in their functionality that they cannot be re-used for other pages that are not in the provided designs.

__Future Friendly__– We require you to use browser technology that meets modern development standards. For example, making use of img srcsets or the `<picture>` element to deliver appropriate images to different screen sizes. If a project does not require IE9 support, you are free to use the Flexbox layout module.

__SEO Conscious__ – Please ensure your sites adhere to SEO best practice. This includes making use of alt and title tags on all images, including the site logo. Please ensure that there is only one `<h1>` and one `<h2>` tag on each page.
Please submit separate files and un-minified code when you use concatenation or minification.

## Design Guidelines
Designs will be provided in layered PSD format. We will require you to adhere as closely to the designs as is reasonably possible unless otherwise agreed.
Along with the designs you will receive a list of colour hexadecimal values, fonts, and point sizes. Please take time to understand the intention of the design instead of merely interpreting it literally. There will no doubt be times when you will need to extrapolate and “fill in the gaps” according to the designers intention.
Please feel free to communicate back to us when you feel that the intention is not clear or a design is problematic, before you start working on it if possible.

## Ethical Practice
Whilst we permit the use or re-use of open source code that you may wish to repurpose, you must respect the licence attached to any code base, image or other software. This means crediting its author where necessary. 
You must inform us if you have made a purchase of a plugin or other code which may require updating for a fee in the future.

## Environments & Version Control
You can develop your website on your local machine in the way that seems best to you. 
We do ask that you submit your code to our Github repository on a regular basis, in line with tasks you have been set: (https://github.com/orgs/blazecommunication/).

## Management
The Product Owner will look after your overall requirements including payment and any further agreements you may wish to make.

The Technical Lead handles project specific issues. Project communication will be via our project management tool and eMail.

Occasionally you may hear from our Account Managers. Please copy any communication you send to them to the product owner and technical lead.
