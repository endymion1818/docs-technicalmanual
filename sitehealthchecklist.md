% new sesssions: 00.00%

Popular pages:

### 4. CTAs

Good Calls to Action (buttons, callout boxes, larger text with links) are proven to increase conversions. You can improve conversions by adding CTAs to the following places:

### 5. Information Architecture

Information Architecture is an analysis of your site's content and layout. It ensures that information is in an appropriate context and is easily accessibly to your visitors. The aim is to reduce cognitive load so that visitors feel comfortable and confident using your site. Good information architecture leads to increased goodwill towards your brand and creates an environment conducive to increased conversions.

we found that some of your provided information is not always placed in a consistent context.

- About us: The content "Explore our vision, mission & values" would be better utilised on the home page
- Why & When: This page is not getting a lot of hits, we believe this is beacause the title is confusing. The content is really informative and could be utilised on the About or Home page to better increase conversions.

We recommend that more attention is given to user journeys to ensure that your website is an effective sales funnel.

Additionally, serving your content over HTTPS will allow your website to download faster.
