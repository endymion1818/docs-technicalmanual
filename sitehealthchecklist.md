## Code quality

### W3C Validation Warnings / Errors

This site has 00 errors on the [W3C Validation Checker](https://validator.w3.org/). These errors should be fixed as soon as possible. 


## Conversion Optimisation

### 1. Analytics

Bounce rate: 00.00%
Average session duration: 00 seconds
% new sesssions: 00.00%

Popular pages:
- / (home page) 000 sessions, 00.0% dropoff

This indicates that you are getting a good hit of new visitors on a regular basis, but are retaining few of them. We recommend applying as many of the suggestions in this document as possible in order to retain more business.

Additionally, we believe more could be done to surface new content to your returning visitors in order to convert bystanders into participants / customers. For example, encouraging visitors to sign up to an email newsletter and regularly send content to them.

### 2. Performance

Industry research has evidenced that there is correlation between bounce rate (how quickly users abandon a site) with performance (how quickly the site loads enough for them to use). We have checked your site with a few industry-standard performance checkers. The standout results are:

- Your site took about 11.595 to load. The established critical dropoff point is 3 seconds
- Loading time has been rated by Google ((**using testmysite.withgoogle.com**)) as POOR with an estimated **31% visitor loss** due to loading time.
- Your website is slower than top performing sites in your industry, which are around 4.1 seconds

We recommend you improve your site by:

#### Reduce Time to First Byte
This typically means your site's server is slow. If you improved your hosting this would likely reduce significantly. 

#### Caching static content
This means that visitors who return will be able to access the site much faster than the first time.

#### Serve static content via a CDN
A CDN is optimised for speed of delivery so it delivers your content faster, allowing the site to render more quickly.

#### Reducing the number of HTTP requests 
Currently your website is requesting 117 resources. This is extremely high. It is possible to reduce this figure massively, up to 3 / 4 resources where possible. Ths means your site will be much smaller and faster, but won't sacrifice how it looks or feels to visitors. 

#### Compressing images
Images make up 25% of your website. if you compress them, less data will need to be transferred, further reducing time. 

#### Minifying JS & CSS
Minifying files removes unecessary space allowing them to be transferred in smaller packets.

#### Concatenating JS & CSS
Concatenating, or joining, these types of files, reduces requests further. Each request is a performance cost.

#### Reducing unused JS & CSS
Your website is 42.9% Javascript. This is huge and it is highly likely most of it is unecessary and not used by your website.



## Security

We have tested your site and found the following results:

- Your site does not have an SSL certificate

An SSL Certificate that ensures your content is encrypted end-to-end is a new standard for websites. Google Chrome and other browsers now display a "site is not secure" message in the address bar of sites without an SSL certificate. Future use of your website may be restricted. 

We have tested your site with ((**WP Scan**)) security testing tool and found the following results:

### Your version of Wordpress is out of date

### You have an insecure plugin
You are using Wordpress Slider Revolution which has 2 serious publicly-known vulnerabilities which are currently being used by hackers in targeted exploits. Earlier this year, thousands of sites were disabled because of this vulnerability. We urge you to update this plugin as soon as possible.
